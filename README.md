Program Overview:

Learn to fuse lidar point clouds, radar signatures, and camera images using Kalman Filters to perceive the environment and detect and track vehicles and pedestrians over time. 

## Projects

[<h2>Lidar Obstacle Detection</h2>](https://github.com/thienan092/Sensor-Fusion-ND/tree/main/Lidar%20Obstacle%20Detection)

<h4>Description: </h4>
<p>
Detect other cars on the road using raw lidar data from Udacityâ€™s real self-driving car, Carla! Implement custom ransac and euclidean clustering algorithms.

* Data set: Pull the data [here](https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection/tree/master/src/sensors/data) and drop it into 'src\sensors\data' directory.
